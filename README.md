#### Belly_Button_Challenge
#### Belly Button Biodiversity

## Description
In this challenge, I was asked to create an interactive dashboard to explore “Belly Button Biodiversity dataset which catalogs the microbes that colonize human navels. The dataset reveals that a small handful of microbial species (also called operational taxonomic units, or OTUs, in the study) were present in more than 70% of people, while the rest were relatively rare.” 

To accomplish this analysis, I utilized my Mac OS, Visual Studio Code, Plotly, D3, Javascript, HTML, JSON, and GitHub.

## Table of Contents
Code for analysis found in the ‘app.js’ & ‘index.html’ files within the main directory on my github 'belly_button_challenge' repo. Data for analysis was compiled into the 'samples.json' located in the ‘starterCode’ directory.

## Installation Instructions
Code utilized for this challenge can be found in the files within the main directory on my github 'belly_button_challenge' repo.

## Usage
Can Git Clone all files from my 'belly_button_challenge' repo.

## Credits
For this challenge I utilized the ASK BCS feature on Slack, Google, ChatGPT, fellow students, YouTube, Stack Overflow, TA assistance, Bootcamp tutor assistance, and educational resources related to the unit provided by the bootcamp.
